This is all giga WIP 

Using a placeholder name for now until I come up with a good description of the changes. 

Why:

- This page will focus on setting up the minimum requirements needed to run o!TR locally for the use of the tournament community / TComm.
- Will require the set up of the Processor and the Database (Stage fact check this)
- Will be all contained within this single page, allowing ease of setup for users, and allowing us to expand each application's documentation with more technical information. The expectation for the repo specific areas will be that only people interested in contributing will access them, allowing us to expand the technical documentation even more.`

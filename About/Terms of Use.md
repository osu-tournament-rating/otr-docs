# API Terms of Use

By using the o!TR API, you agree to abide by these terms of use. The o!TR API is provided by the osu! Tournament Rating Team ("o!TR Team", "us", "our") for free.

## Accreditation

Data which is sourced from us should be credited properly. Misleading users to believe data created by us is provided by another source, or failing to credit this information as being created by us, is not allowed. While we do source our input data from osu!, the service we provide as a result of curating and processing this data is our own creation.

> [!warning]
>  For example, informing users of your application that information is provided by osu! officially is not allowed because it is not true.

### Abuse

Users who abuse this service will have their API access revoked. Users found to consistently exceed the rate limit will have their access revoked.

#### Scraping

The API must not be used to scrape information. Scraping data in any form is prohibited and will result in a permanent revocation of API access. Please see the [[Data|data]] page for more information on conveniently importing our dataset.

#### Multiple Clients

Multiple clients may be used so long as each client serves separate purposes. The use of multiple clients for a single application is prohibited.

#### Rate Limit Increases

If you wish to receive an increase to the API rate limit of your application, please [[Contact|contact us]] with your use case.

# Database Terms of Use

By using any of the o!TR database's public replicas offered [here](https://data.otr.stagec.xyz/), you agree to abide by these terms of use. 

## Restrictions

These replicas are provided explicitly for those who are doing the following:

1. Testing or modifying one or more official osu! Tournament Rating [(o!TR)](https://github.com/osu-tournament-rating)  programs with the intention of testing and contributing to the official repositories. 
2. Validating a tournament's usage of the o!TR system by inspecting a dataset from a specific time period as needed.

### Permissions

Permission to use this dataset in third-party applications, outside of the above exceptions, is not implicitly granted. Please [[Contact#Quick links|contact us]] with your use case before integrating our dataset into any of your applications. 

If such permission is granted, the osu! Tournament Rating project must be [[About/Terms of Use#Accreditation|properly credited]] anywhere our dataset is used.

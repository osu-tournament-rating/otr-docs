Welcome to the o!TR Docs! Our documentation may be browsed online [here](https://docs.otr.stagec.xyz/). All documentation for the o!TR project, including this repository, is hosted there.

The `otr-docs` repository uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to render and serve our files to the web. Quartz is included in this repository as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

The [Team](https://docs.otr.stagec.xyz/About/Team) is not affiliated with Quartz in any way. To view our original work, please browse to the `./docs` directory. The `quartz` directory is only used during deployment, feel free to ignore it.

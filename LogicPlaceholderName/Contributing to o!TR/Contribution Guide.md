Those who wish to make open-source contributions to any o!TR repository must adhere to this contribution guide.

# Claiming an Issue

If you're a first-time contributor, we encourage you to start by working on low-priority tasks. This helps you familiarize yourself with the project without the pressure of tackling more urgent issues.

Contributors with a history of consistent code submissions are welcome to take on medium or high-priority issues. Critical issues, however, should be reserved for the o!TR team.

## Pull Requests

The o!TR team expects the following from pull request (PR) authors:

1. Titles must be clear and concise.
2. Changes must be listed in the description box.
3. If a PR closes a specific branch, include this in the description: `closes #x`.
4. All PRs must target the master branch.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do

1. Write descriptive PRs.
2. Get approval to work on an issue or new feature (even if it's not currently on the board) from an o!TR team member.
3. Create new issues for the item you want to work on, if approved.
4. Write small PRs (touching 5-10 files at most).

### Don't

1. Create PRs without consulting the o!TR team.
2. Leave the description field blank.
3. Claim high priority issues without communicating with the o!TR team / as a first-time contributor.
4. Make database schema changes without approval from the o!TR team.

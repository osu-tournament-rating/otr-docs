## API Terms of Use

By using the o!TR API ("API"), you agree to abide by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). The o!TR API is provided by the osu! Tournament Rating Team ("o!TR Team", "us", "our") to our users for free.

### Accreditation

Data which is sourced from us should be credited properly. Misleading users to believe data created by us is provided by another source, or failing to credit this information as being created by us, is not allowed, outside of specific exceptions outlined below. While we do source our input data from the [osu! API](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/wiki), the service we provide as a result of curating and processing this data is our sole creation.

> [!warning]
> For example, informing users of your application that information is provided by osu! officially is against these Terms and may result in API access being revoked.

#### Abuse

Users who abuse this service will have their API access revoked without warning. Users found to consistently exceed the rate limit will have their access revoked.

##### Scraping

The API must not be used to scrape information. Scraping data in any form is prohibited and will result in a permanent revocation of API access. Please see the [[Replicas|data]] page for more information on conveniently importing our dataset.

##### Multiple Clients

Multiple clients may be used so long as each client serves a distinct, separate purpose. The use of multiple clients for a single application is prohibited unless approved in writing by [[Team|Stage]].

> [!tip]
> If you are a tournament host, you may create one API client per tournament assuming the client's usage is restricted to tournament operations only.

##### Rate Limit Increases

The standard rate limit for a given client is \*\*\*\*

If you wish to receive an increase to the API rate limit of your application, please [[Contact|contact us]] with your use case.

##### Logging

By using our API, you hereby consent to us logging the activity of all API clients you create for the specific purpose of monitoring for violation of these Terms.

2. Validating a tournament's usage of the o!TR platform by inspecting a dataset from a specific time period as needed.

> [!info]
> Certain data is omitted to protect user privacy. Refer to [[Replicas#Public Replicas|this page]] for more specifics.

#### Permissions

Permission to use this dataset in third-party applications, outside of the above exceptions, is not implicitly granted. Please [[Contact#Quick links|contact us]] with your use case before integrating our dataset into any of your applications.

If such permission is granted, the osu! Tournament Rating project must be [[Terms of Use#Accreditation|properly credited]] anywhere our dataset is used.

# Automated Checks

The [](DataWorkerService.md) has numerous responsibilities, one of them being a data processing step known as automated checks. These checks are responsible for identifying, flagging, and in some cases fixing various discrepancies found in our data.

## Flow

Automation checks are performed in the following order.

```Mermaid

    GameScore --> Game --> Match --> Tournament

The following elements contain flowcharts that give detailed information on each step of the automation order.

## FAQ

### How can a human manually mark all entities as `Verified`?

Most of the manual review process occurs at the `Match` and `Game` levels. For example, if a `Match` has too many invalid games, it will be marked as `PreRejected` and require manual intervention. The same is true for `Game`s.

For `GameScore` entities, there are concrete rules which determine whether it should be `PreRejected`, for example if the `Score` value is below the minimum (and thus very likely comes from a referee in the lobby or other anomaly). It is rare for a `GameScore`'s `PreRejected` flag to be manually overturned.

Additionally, a web interface exists which allows reviewers to mark an entity - and all of its children - as `Verified` or `Rejected`. Generally speaking, if at a glance everything is marked as `PreVerified`, little effort is required to manually approve these submissions as they can be approved in one click.

### In what cases should a human reviewer override a `PreRejected` status?

One example of where this should happen is [Corsace Open 2023](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1794106?n=1). This tournament has numerous matches marked as `PreRejected` by the system due to not having matches which consistently use the same prefix. This is a case in which the human reviewer should manually override the system's `PreRejected` status (assuming the `RejectionReason`s are of type `MatchRejectionReason.NamePrefixMismatch`).

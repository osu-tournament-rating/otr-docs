Our docs are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). While we do not rely on any plugins, we do utilize [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) to check over our formatting before merging. Please ensure the below style rules are followed while working on the docs.

## Obsidian Settings

The following Obsidian settings are recommended to ensure formatting is applied correctly:

| Path                                  | Value | Enforced |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Editor > Display > Show line numbers  | true  |          |
| Editor > Behavior > Indent using tabs | false | Yes      |

## Linting

The easiest way to lint your files is by using the [markdownlint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Then, from VS Code, run `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Lint all Markdown files in the workspace with markdownlint`. This will generate a report of what needs to be changed.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of rules to follow when writing Markdown.

### Headings

- There should never be any `#`-level headings in any document.
- The largest heading must be `##`.
- There must not be any headings smaller than `##` without a parent heading.
- Each subheading must increment by exactly one step (`##` -> `###`).
- There must be one empty line before and after each heading.
- There must always be plain text at the top of the file before introducing a `##` heading.

### Lists

- All list items containing independent clauses must end with a period.
- All lists must have a blank line before and after them.
- Nested lists are okay.

#### Ordered Lists

- Ordered lists must be in `1. 1. 1.` format.

#### Unordered Lists

- Unordered list items must use dashes (`-`) in front of line items.

### Code blocks

- All multi-line code blocks must have one blank line before and after them.

### Files

- Each file must have one blank line at the end.

### Links and Aliases

- When using `[[wikilink]]` syntax to include links in the middle of a sentence, alias them to match the surrounding wording. For example, `[[Team]]` is often aliased as `team` to maintain sentence structure. Links can be aliased like so: `[[Team|team]]`.
    - This applies to both capitalization and wording of the entire link. Consider the following example: `"Read our [[Setup For Local Use|setup guide]] for more information."`

## Tags

All tags must be listed as file properties as follows:

```
---
tags:
  - math
---
```

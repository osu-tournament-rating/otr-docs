The [[Team|team]] is more than happy to accept contributions from anyone! This article covers how to contribute effectively and defines what the team expects from all contributors.

If you've never made an open-source contribution before, here's how:

## Prerequisites

1. Install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you're on MacOS or Linux, `git` is already installed. If on Windows, it's a great idea to follow all of our instructions using git bash as that terminal supports Linux commands.
2. If needed, install a `git` helper, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
3. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).

## Forks & Pull Requests

1. Browse our repositories [here](https://github.com/osu-tournament-rating).
2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) any repositories you wish to contribute to.
3. Clone the forked repository using [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository).
4. Once cloned, create a new feature branch (e.g. `feature/my-cool-change`). Make your code changes, then [commit](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_commit.asp) and [push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) those changes to your fork.
5. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). This will allow the [[Team|team]] to review your code before merging any changes. Once your code is merged, celebrate! You just made o!TR better for everyone.
